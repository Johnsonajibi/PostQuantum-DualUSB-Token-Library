## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### üö® Critical Security Issues

For critical security vulnerabilities that could compromise user data:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email the maintainer directly at: [security@yourproject.com]
4. **DO** include detailed information about the vulnerability

### üìß Security Report Template

```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 72 hours  
- **Progress Updates:** Weekly until resolved
- **Fix Release:** Target 30 days for critical issues

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

This library implements multiple security layers:

#### Cryptographic Security
- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption with associated data
- **Argon2id**: Memory-hard key derivation function
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Message authentication codes
- **Dilithium**: Post-quantum digital signatures
- **Constant-time operations**: Timing attack protection

#### Memory Security
- **Secure allocation**: Memory locking (VirtualLock/mlock)
- **Automatic clearing**: Sensitive data wiped after use
- **Stack protection**: Compiler flags enabled
- **Heap protection**: Modern allocator features

#### Input Validation
- **Path sanitization**: Prevents directory traversal
- **Type checking**: Runtime type validation
- **Bounds checking**: Buffer overflow protection
- **Format validation**: Structured data validation

#### Physical Security
- **Dual USB requirement**: No single point of failure
- **Device binding**: Hardware fingerprinting
- **Tamper evidence**: Audit log integrity
- **Access controls**: Permission validation

### üîç Security Testing

We employ multiple testing methodologies:

- **Static analysis**: Code scanning with security rules
- **Dynamic testing**: Runtime security validation
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing
- **Penetration testing**: Simulated attack scenarios
- **Code review**: Manual security assessment
