A comprehensive **Python library** for post-quantum cryptographic dual USB backup operations with advanced hardware security features and side-channel attack countermeasures.

> **üìö This is a library package** designed to be imported into your applications. It provides a set of functions to manage secure backups.

## üìã Overview

The **PQC Dual USB Library** provides a robust, enterprise-grade solution for securing data against threats from both classical and quantum computers. It offers a functional API for developers to integrate post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into applications requiring secure data storage, especially for scenarios involving redundant backups on physical devices like USB drives.

The library is designed with a "secure-by-default" philosophy, automatically handling complex security operations like side-channel attack mitigation, secure memory management, and hybrid cryptographic schemes.

### Quick Import Example

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from pqcdualusb.storage import init_dual_usb, rotate_token, verify_dual_setup
from pqcdualusb.backup import restore_from_backup
from pqcdualusb.pqc import pq_write_audit_keys

# Use these functions to build your backup workflow.
# See the Quick Start Guide below for a detailed example.
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Vision

The core architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and secure. It abstracts the complexity of cryptographic backends and hardware interactions, providing a clean and simple functional API to the application layer.

### High-Level Architecture

The library is composed of several focused modules that work together:

-   **`storage.py`**: Manages the state of the primary drive and orchestrates high-level operations like initialization and key rotation.
-   **`backup.py`**: Handles the creation and restoration of encrypted backup files.
-   **`crypto.py`**: Contains all core classical cryptographic logic, including key derivation (Argon2id) and authenticated encryption (AES-GCM).
-   **`pqc.py`**: Manages all Post-Quantum Cryptography operations (key generation, signing) using available backends.
-   **`device.py`**: Provides helper functions to validate device paths and check their properties (e.g., if they are removable).
-   **`audit.py`**: Implements a secure, structured logging system for all critical security events.
-   **`cli.py`**: Provides a reference implementation of a command-line interface that demonstrates how to use the library's functions.

### PQC Backend Selection Logic

The library prioritizes performance and security by intelligently selecting the best available Post-Quantum Cryptography backend. This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process.

```mermaid

    A["Start: PostQuantumCrypto.__init__"] --> B{"Rust PQC Backend Available?"};
    B -- Yes --> C["Set Backend = 'rust_pqc'"];
    B -- No --> D{"python-oqs Backend Available?"};
    D -- Yes --> E["Set Backend = 'oqs'"];
    D -- No --> F["Raise RuntimeError: 'No PQC backend found'"];
    C --> G["End: Ready for PQC Ops"];
    E --> G;
```

## üåü Key Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-standardized Kyber1024 (KEM) and Dilithium3 (signatures).
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines classical AES-256-GCM with post-quantum key encapsulation for robust, dual-layer protection.
- **Power Analysis Protection**: Built-in software countermeasures (instruction jitter, random delays) to obfuscate power consumption patterns and mitigate side-channel attacks.
- **Secure Key Derivation**: Uses Argon2id, a memory-hard function, to stretch user passphrases and resist brute-force attacks.

### Hardware & Memory Security
- **Dual USB Backup**: Manages redundant, secure storage across multiple USB devices.
- **Device Validation**: Functions to verify that provided paths are on distinct, removable devices.
- **Secure Memory Management**: Automatically zeroes out memory that held sensitive data (keys, plaintexts) to prevent data leakage.
- **Timing Attack Mitigation**: Employs constant-time comparison operations where possible to prevent attackers from inferring secret data through timing variations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Threat Model and Security Guarantees

This library is designed to protect against a range of threats, from common software vulnerabilities to sophisticated nation-state-level attacks.

### Attack Vectors Considered
- **Quantum Attacks**: An adversary with a large-scale quantum computer attempting to break public-key cryptography.
    - **Mitigation**: **Hybrid Encryption**. The use of Kyber1024 ensures that even if classical algorithms are broken, the encapsulated key remains secure.
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks and power analysis.
    - **Mitigation**: Constant-time operations for critical comparisons and software-based countermeasures like instruction jitter and randomized dummy operations.
- **Physical Access Attacks**: Cold boot attacks or theft of USB drives.
    - **Mitigation**: **Secure Memory Wiping** and strong, multi-layered encryption. Data on the drives is useless without the user's passphrase.

### Limitations
- This library cannot protect against keyloggers, screen-capture malware, or other compromises of the host operating system. The security of the overall system depends on the security of the environment in which it runs.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is under active development. Our goals for the near future include:

### Q4 2025
- **[Feature] High-Level `BackupManager` Class**:
    - Implement an optional `BackupManager` class to provide a simpler, high-level API for orchestrating dual-drive backups.
- **[Security] External Security Audit**:
    - Engage a third-party security firm to perform a full audit of the cryptographic and security-sensitive code.
- **[CI/CD] Automated PyPI Publishing**:
    - Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish new releases to PyPI upon tagging.

### Q1 2026
- **[Feature] Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support**:
    - Add an abstraction layer to support storing PQC keys on HSMs (e.g., YubiKey, NitroKey) via a PKCS#11 interface.
- **[Performance] SIMD-Optimized Backends**:
    - Integrate official PQC implementations that use AVX2/NEON instructions for significant performance gains on supported platforms.

# The initial secret data you want to protect
initial_secret = os.urandom(64)


# In a real scenario, you would validate the drives are removable.
# For this example, we assume they are.
# assert _is_removable_path(primary_path)
# assert _is_removable_path(backup_path)


# 1. Initialize the Dual USB Backup
print("\nStep 1: Initializing the dual USB backup...")

    primary_mount=primary_path,
    backup_mount=backup_path,
    passphrase=passphrase,
    prev_rotation=0
)

print(f"   - New rotation counter: {rotate_info['rotation']}")


# 4. Verify the Complete Setup After Rotation
print("\nStep 4: Verifying the entire setup after rotation...")
# Get the latest token file from the primary drive
latest_token_path = sorted(primary_path.glob("token_*.bin"))[-1]
is_setup_valid = verify_dual_setup(
    primary_token_path=latest_token_path,
    backup_file=Path(rotate_info['backup']),
    passphrase=passphrase,
    enforce_device=False,      # Set to True in production on real hardware
