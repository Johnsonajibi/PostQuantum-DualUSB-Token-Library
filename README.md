A comprehensive **Python library** for post-quantum cryptographic dual USB backup operations with advanced hardware security features and side-channel attack countermeasures.

> **üìö This is a library package** designed to be imported into your applications. It provides a set of functions to manage secure backups.

## üìã Overview

The **PQC Dual USB Library** provides a robust, enterprise-grade solution for securing data against threats from both classical and quantum computers. It offers a functional API for developers to integrate post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into applications requiring secure data storage, especially for scenarios involving redundant backups on physical devices like USB drives.

The library is designed with a "secure-by-default" philosophy, automatically handling complex security operations like side-channel attack mitigation, secure memory management, and hybrid cryptographic schemes.

### Quick Import Example

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from pqcdualusb.storage import init_dual_usb, rotate_token, verify_dual_setup
from pqcdualusb.backup import restore_from_backup
from pqcdualusb.pqc import pq_write_audit_keys

# Use these functions to build your backup workflow.
# See the Quick Start Guide below for a detailed example.
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Vision

The core architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and secure. It abstracts the complexity of cryptographic backends and hardware interactions, providing a clean and simple functional API to the application layer.

### High-Level Architecture

The library is composed of several focused modules that work together:

-   **`storage.py`**: Manages the state of the primary drive and orchestrates high-level operations like initialization and key rotation.
-   **`backup.py`**: Handles the creation and restoration of encrypted backup files.
-   **`crypto.py`**: Contains all core classical cryptographic logic, including key derivation (Argon2id) and authenticated encryption (AES-GCM).
-   **`pqc.py`**: Manages all Post-Quantum Cryptography operations (key generation, signing) using available backends.
-   **`device.py`**: Provides helper functions to validate device paths and check their properties (e.g., if they are removable).
-   **`audit.py`**: Implements a secure, structured logging system for all critical security events.
-   **`cli.py`**: Provides a reference implementation of a command-line interface that demonstrates how to use the library's functions.

### PQC Backend Selection Logic

The library prioritizes performance and security by intelligently selecting the best available Post-Quantum Cryptography backend. This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: PostQuantumCrypto.__init__"] --> B{"Rust PQC Backend Available?"};
    B -- Yes --> C["Set Backend = 'rust_pqc'"];
    B -- No --> D{"python-oqs Backend Available?"};
    D -- Yes --> E["Set Backend = 'oqs'"];
    D -- No --> F["Raise RuntimeError: 'No PQC backend found'"];
    C --> G["End: Ready for PQC Ops"];
    E --> G;
```

## üåü Key Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-standardized Kyber1024 (KEM) and Dilithium3 (signatures).
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines classical AES-256-GCM with post-quantum key encapsulation for robust, dual-layer protection.
- **Power Analysis Protection**: Built-in software countermeasures (instruction jitter, random delays) to obfuscate power consumption patterns and mitigate side-channel attacks.
- **Secure Key Derivation**: Uses Argon2id, a memory-hard function, to stretch user passphrases and resist brute-force attacks.

### Hardware & Memory Security
- **Dual USB Backup**: Manages redundant, secure storage across multiple USB devices.
- **Device Validation**: Functions to verify that provided paths are on distinct, removable devices.
- **Secure Memory Management**: Automatically zeroes out memory that held sensitive data (keys, plaintexts) to prevent data leakage.
- **Timing Attack Mitigation**: Employs constant-time comparison operations where possible to prevent attackers from inferring secret data through timing variations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Threat Model and Security Guarantees

This library is designed to protect against a range of threats, from common software vulnerabilities to sophisticated nation-state-level attacks.

### Attack Vectors Considered
- **Quantum Attacks**: An adversary with a large-scale quantum computer attempting to break public-key cryptography.
    - **Mitigation**: **Hybrid Encryption**. The use of Kyber1024 ensures that even if classical algorithms are broken, the encapsulated key remains secure.
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks and power analysis.
    - **Mitigation**: Constant-time operations for critical comparisons and software-based countermeasures like instruction jitter and randomized dummy operations.
- **Physical Access Attacks**: Cold boot attacks or theft of USB drives.
    - **Mitigation**: **Secure Memory Wiping** and strong, multi-layered encryption. Data on the drives is useless without the user's passphrase.

### Limitations
- This library cannot protect against keyloggers, screen-capture malware, or other compromises of the host operating system. The security of the overall system depends on the security of the environment in which it runs.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is under active development. Our goals for the near future include:

### Q4 2025
- **[Feature] High-Level `BackupManager` Class**:
    - Implement an optional `BackupManager` class to provide a simpler, high-level API for orchestrating dual-drive backups.
- **[Security] External Security Audit**:
    - Engage a third-party security firm to perform a full audit of the cryptographic and security-sensitive code.
- **[CI/CD] Automated PyPI Publishing**:
    - Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish new releases to PyPI upon tagging.

### Q1 2026
- **[Feature] Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support**:
    - Add an abstraction layer to support storing PQC keys on HSMs (e.g., YubiKey, NitroKey) via a PKCS#11 interface.
- **[Performance] SIMD-Optimized Backends**:
    - Integrate official PQC implementations that use AVX2/NEON instructions for significant performance gains on supported platforms.

    Storage->>Storage: Remove old token and backup files
    
    Storage-->>-App: {rotation: 1, backup: new_backup_path}
```

### 4. Cryptographic Pipeline

The library uses a hybrid cryptographic model, combining classical authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) with post-quantum key encapsulation (Kyber) to derive the final encryption key.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Inputs"
        A[User Passphrase]
        B[Per-backup Salt]
        C[Plaintext Secret]
    end

    subgraph "Key Derivation & Encapsulation"
        A -- Argon2id --> D{Derived Classical Key (DCK)}
        
        subgraph "PQC Module"
            E[PQC KEM Keypair Generation] --> F{Kyber Public Key (K_pub)}
            E --> G{Kyber Secret Key (K_sec)}
        end

        F -- Kyber KEM Encapsulate --> H{Ciphertext (CT)}
        F -- Kyber KEM Encapsulate --> I{Shared Secret 1 (SS1)}
    end

    subgraph "Hybrid Key Generation"
        D & I -- "SHA-256 KDF" --> J{Final Encryption Key (FEK)}
    end

    subgraph "Encryption & Packaging"
        C & J -- "AES-256-GCM Encrypt" --> K{Encrypted Data}
        
        F & H & K --> L((Encrypted Backup File<br><i>Contains: K_pub, CT, Encrypted Data, Salt, Nonce, Tag</i>))
    end

    G -- "Stored by user/app<br>Needed for decryption" --> M((Decryption Process))

    style L fill:#d4edda
```

### 5. File System Layout

The library creates a specific file and directory structure on the primary and backup USB drives to maintain state and store cryptographic materials securely.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Primary USB Drive"
        direction TB
        root_p["/ (mount point)"]
        root_p --> token["token_{rotation}.bin<br><i>Raw secret data.</i>"]
        root_p --> state["state.json<br><i>{ 'rotation': 1, 'device_id': '...' }</i>"]
    end

    subgraph "Backup USB Drive"
        direction TB
        root_b["/ (mount point)"]
        root_b --> hidden_dir[".system_backup/"]
        hidden_dir --> backup_file["backup_{rotation}.enc<br><i>Encrypted secret (AES-GCM), includes PQC public key and metadata.</i>"]
    end

    subgraph "Host System (User Home)"
        direction TB
        host_root["~/"]
        host_root --> audit_key[".pqcdualusb_audit.key<br><i>HMAC key for securing the audit log.</i>"]
        host_root --> audit_log["pqcdualusb_audit.log<br><i>Append-only log of all security events.</i>"]
    end
```

### 6. Security Threat Model & Mitigations

The security of the library is built on a defense-in-depth strategy, mapping specific threats to concrete mitigation techniques implemented in the code.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Threats"
        T1["<b>Quantum Computer Attack</b><br>An adversary uses a quantum computer to break classical public-key crypto."]
        T2["<b>Side-Channel Attack</b><br>Attacker analyzes power consumption or timing to leak secrets."]
        T3["<b>Physical Theft of Drive(s)</b><br>An attacker steals one or both USB drives."]
        T4["<b>Brute-Force on Passphrase</b><br>Attacker tries to guess the passphrase to decrypt the backup."]
        T5["<b>Data Corruption</b><br>Power loss during a write operation corrupts a file."]
        T6["<b>Memory Forensics</b><br>Attacker reads RAM (e.g., cold boot attack) to find keys."]
    end

    subgraph "Mitigations"
        M1["<b>Hybrid Encryption (crypto.py, pqc.py)</b><br>AES-GCM + Kyber1024 KEM. Even if one is broken, data remains secure."]
        M2["<b>Software Countermeasures (crypto.py)</b><br>Constant-time comparisons and secure memory wiping add noise and prevent leaks."]
        M3["<b>Authenticated Encryption (crypto.py)</b><br>AES-GCM ensures data cannot be decrypted or modified without the correct passphrase."]
        M4["<b>Key Derivation Function (crypto.py)</b><br>Argon2id is memory-hard, making brute-force computationally infeasible."]
        M5["<b>Atomic Writes (utils.py)</b><br>Files are written to a temporary location and then moved, preventing partial writes."]
        M6["<b>Secure Memory Wiping (crypto.py)</b><br>The `SecureMemory` context manager explicitly zeroes out sensitive data after use."]
    end

    T1 --> M1
    T2 --> M2
    T3 --> M3
