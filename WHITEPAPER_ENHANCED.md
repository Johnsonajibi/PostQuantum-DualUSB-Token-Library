## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical analysis of the pqcdualusb library, including detailed architecture diagrams, security analysis, and implementation specifications. The system implements a novel dual-USB secret storage mechanism with post-quantum cryptographic protection, side-channel attack mitigation, and enterprise-grade security features.

**Key Innovations:**
- Dual-drive physical secret splitting with quantum-resistant encryption
- Comprehensive side-channel attack protection (timing, power, cache)
- Device binding with tamper-evident audit logging
- Rollback protection through monotonic counters
- Hybrid classical + post-quantum cryptography
