# AI Comments Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed conversational and AI-style comments from the pqcdualusb library files to maintain professional code quality.

## Files Modified

### 1. `pqcdualusb/crypto.py`

#### Removed Comments:
- ❌ "Uh-oh, no PQC available. Falling back to classical RSA-4096"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Fallback to classical RSA-4096 (not quantum-safe)"

- ❌ "This is NOT quantum-safe but better than nothing!"
  - ✅ Removed (redundant)

- ❌ "Generate a big RSA key (4096 bits should hold up for now)"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Generate RSA-4096 key"

- ❌ "Standard public exponent" (inline comment)
  - ✅ Removed

  - ✅ Removed

  - ✅ Removed (obvious from context)

- ❌ "In-memory only - app must encrypt for storage" (inline comment)
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "If we have power analysis protection hardware, use it! This prevents side-channel attacks via power consumption monitoring"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Apply power analysis protection if enabled"

- ❌ "We try multiple import paths to handle both installed wheels and dev builds"
  - ✅ Removed (implementation detail)

- ❌ "Path 1: Try the normal installed package location"
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "In a more sophisticated system, we'd use HKDF here, but SHA-256 works fine"
  - ✅ Removed (unnecessary justification)

- ❌ "Argon2id is the current gold standard for password hashing. It's:"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Derive encryption key from passphrase using Argon2id."

- ❌ "Use Argon2id - the best choice for password hashing"

  - ✅ Removed from import comment

- ❌ "No hardware protection available, just run directly"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "No hardware protection available"

  - ✅ Replaced with: "Classical fallback: reuse RSA keypair"

- ❌ "Use power analysis protection if available"
  - ✅ Removed (obvious from if statement)

- ❌ "No PQC secret available - just use classical derivation. (This is less secure but still reasonable)"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "No PQC secret available, use classical derivation"

- ❌ "Hybrid mode: combine both sources of entropy"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Hybrid mode: combine both entropy sources"

- ❌ "First, derive a key from the passphrase"
  - ✅ Removed (obvious from code)

- ❌ "Then mix it with the PQC shared secret"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Mix with PQC shared secret"

- ❌ "We add a version tag to domain-separate different key types"
  - ✅ Removed (obvious from code)

- ❌ "Final mixing: take first 32 bytes of PQC secret and hash"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Final mixing"

- ❌ "Package everything up. We hex-encode bytes so it's JSON-serializable"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Package encrypted data"

- ❌ "Include the encapsulated secret so receiver can decrypt it"
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "GCM mode provides both confidentiality and authentication"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Use AES-GCM for authenticated encryption"

- ❌ "No additional authenticated data" (inline comment)
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "If this succeeds, we know: 1. The key was correct 2. The data wasn't tampered with (GCM auth tag verified)"
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "GCM authentication failed - either wrong key or corrupted data"
  - ✅ Removed (error message is sufficient)

### 2. `pqcdualusb/utils.py`

#### Removed Comments:
- ❌ "Additional cleanup could be added here"
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "This is mainly a placeholder for any global cleanup needed"
  - ✅ Removed

### 3. `pqcdualusb/security.py`

#### Removed Comments:
- ❌ "Exponential distribution for more natural timing variation"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Exponential distribution for timing variation"

- ❌ "Most delays will be short, with occasional longer delays"
  - ✅ Removed

- ❌ "Shape parameter" (inline comment)
  - ✅ Removed

### 4. `pqcdualusb/usb.py`

#### Removed Comments:
- ❌ "If diskutil info fails, assume it might be removable"
  - ✅ Replaced with: "Assume removable if diskutil info fails"

- ❌ "If we can't determine, include it"
  - ✅ Removed (obvious from except block)

## Comment Categories Removed

### 1. Conversational Language
- "Uh-oh", "better than nothing", "should hold up for now"
- "just", "simply", "basically"
- "Let's", "We", "Here's"

### 2. Overly Casual Explanations
- "still pretty good", "easy to store", "works fine"
- "the best choice", "gold standard"

### 3. Redundant Explanations
- Comments that repeat what the code already says
- Obvious parameter descriptions
- Inline comments explaining standard constants

### 4. AI-Generated Patterns
- Multi-line justifications for implementation choices
- "This is X but Y" patterns
- Step-by-step narration ("First..., Then...")

### 5. Placeholder References
- "This is mainly a placeholder"
- "could be added here"

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before Examples:
```python
# Uh-oh, no PQC available. Falling back to classical RSA-4096
# This is NOT quantum-safe but better than nothing!
private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,  # Standard public exponent
    key_size=4096,  # Big key = more security against classical attacks
)
```

### After:
```python
# Fallback to classical RSA-4096 (not quantum-safe)
private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=4096,
)
```

### Before:
```python
# Hybrid mode: combine both sources of entropy
# First, derive a key from the passphrase
classical_key = self._derive_classical_key(passphrase, salt)

# Then mix it with the PQC shared secret
# We add a version tag to domain-separate different key types
combined_input = classical_key + pq_shared_secret + b"PQC_HYBRID_V1"
```

### After:
```python
# Hybrid mode: combine both entropy sources
classical_key = self._derive_classical_key(passphrase, salt)

# Mix with PQC shared secret
combined_input = classical_key + pq_shared_secret + b"PQC_HYBRID_V1"
```

## Summary Statistics

- **Files Modified**: 4 (crypto.py, utils.py, security.py, usb.py)
- **Comments Removed**: ~40 conversational/AI-style comments
- **Comments Improved**: ~15 comments made more concise
- **Code Changed**: 0 lines (only comments modified)
- **Functionality Changed**: None

## Guidelines Applied

### ✅ Keep:
- Technical explanations (security properties, algorithm names)
- Non-obvious implementation rationale
- Security warnings and gotchas
- Fallback behavior descriptions

### ❌ Remove:
- Conversational language ("Uh-oh", "should work", "pretty good")
- Obvious explanations that repeat code
- Step-by-step narration of simple operations
- Inline comments for standard parameters
- AI-generated justifications

### ✏️ Improve:
- Long explanations → Concise technical descriptions
- Conversational tone → Professional technical tone
- Multi-line justifications → Single-line statements

## Result

The library code now has:
- ✅ Professional, concise comments
- ✅ Technical accuracy maintained
- ✅ No conversational AI patterns
- ✅ Clear, focused documentation
- ✅ Industry-standard comment style

All functionality remains identical. Only comment style has been improved for professional code quality.
