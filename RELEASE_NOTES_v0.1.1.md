# PostQuantum DualUSB Token Library v0.1.1

## Documentation Overhaul and Consolidation

This release focuses on a major cleanup and enhancement of the project's documentation. We've consolidated duplicated information, added detailed architectural diagrams, and provided a clearer security model to improve developer experience and clarity.

## What's New in This Release

### ðŸ“š Comprehensive Documentation Update
- **Consolidated README**: The main `README.md` has been completely rewritten to be a single, authoritative source of information. All duplicated content has been removed.
- **New Architectural Diagrams**: Added several Mermaid.js diagrams to the `README.md` to visually explain the library's architecture, data flows, and security layers.
- **Threat Model and Security Guarantees**: A new, detailed section in the `README.md` outlines the specific threats the library is designed to mitigate and the security guarantees it provides.
- **Project Roadmap**: The project's future plans are now included directly in the `README.md`.
- **Synchronized PyPI README**: The `PYPI_README.md` has been updated to reflect the new, streamlined content of the main README, providing a better experience for users on the Python Package Index.

###  housekeeping
- **Updated Changelog**: The `CHANGELOG.md` now reflects all recent documentation changes under a new "Unreleased" section.
- **Removed Redundant Files**: Deleted the standalone `ROADMAP.md` as its content is now part of the main `README.md`.

## Why This Matters
Clear, accurate, and comprehensive documentation is crucial for a security library. This update makes it easier for developers to:
- Understand the library's design and capabilities.
- Correctly integrate the library into their applications.
- Trust the security of the implementation by understanding its threat model.

## Installation

No code changes are included in this release. To install the library, you can still use pip:

```bash
pip install pqcdualusb
