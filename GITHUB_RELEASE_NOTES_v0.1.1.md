## PostQuantum DualUSB Token Library v0.1.1

This release is a major documentation overhaul, focused on clarity, accuracy, and developer experience. We've consolidated all project information into a single, authoritative `README.md`, added detailed architectural diagrams, and provided a comprehensive threat model.

### Key Changes
- **Complete README Rewrite**: The `README.md` is now the central source of truth, with all duplicated content removed.
- **New Architectural Diagrams**: Added Mermaid.js diagrams for high-level architecture, component relationships, data flows, and side-channel protections.
- **New Security Sections**: Added a detailed "Threat Model and Security Guarantees" section.
- **Consolidated Roadmap**: The project roadmap is now part of the main `README.md`.
- **Updated PyPI README**: The summary on PyPI is now synchronized with the main README.

This update makes it easier than ever to understand, integrate, and trust the library for securing your applications against quantum threats.
