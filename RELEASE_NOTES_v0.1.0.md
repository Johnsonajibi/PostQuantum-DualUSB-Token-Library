# PostQuantum DualUSB Token Library v0.1.0

## Initial Release - Enterprise Security Meets Quantum Resistance

We're proud to announce the first official release of PostQuantum DualUSB Token Library. This Python package delivers enterprise-grade dual USB backup functionality with cutting-edge post-quantum cryptography protection.

After months of development and testing, we're confident this library provides the security foundation needed for protecting sensitive data in an uncertain cryptographic future.

## What's New in This Release

### Post-Quantum Cryptographic Protection
This release implements quantum-resistant security measures that will protect your data even when large-scale quantum computers become available:

- **Dilithium digital signatures** provide authentication that quantum computers cannot break
- **Future-proof design** follows NIST post-quantum cryptography recommendations  
- **Backward compatibility** ensures current systems work while preparing for quantum threats

### Dual USB Security Architecture
We've designed a split-secret system that maximizes physical security:

- **No single point of failure** - your secrets are distributed across two USB devices
- **Physical separation** provides air-gapped security for offline environments
- **Device binding** prevents attackers from cloning USB drives
- **Tamper detection** alerts you to unauthorized access attempts

### Enterprise-Grade Features
This library includes the security features you'd expect from commercial solutions:

- **Memory protection** locks sensitive data in RAM and clears it automatically
- **Timing attack resistance** uses constant-time operations to prevent side-channel attacks
- **Comprehensive audit logging** creates tamper-evident records of all operations
- **Cross-platform compatibility** works reliably on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems

### Developer Experience Improvements
We've prioritized making this library easy to integrate and use:

- **Simple installation** via PyPI with `pip install pqcdualusb`
- **Intuitive command-line interface** with smart USB drive detection
- **Clean Python API** for programmatic integration into existing systems
- **Real-time progress reporting** keeps users informed during long operations
- **Comprehensive error handling** helps developers debug integration issues

## Installation and Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows, Linux, or macOS operating system
- Two USB drives for dual storage setup

### Installation
The easiest way to get started is through PyPI:

```bash
pip install pqcdualusb
```

For development or the latest features, you can install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Johnsonajibi/PostQuantum-DualUSB-Token-Library.git
cd PostQuantum-DualUSB-Token-Library
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage
Here's how to get up and running with dual USB security:

```bash
# Set up your dual USB configuration
pqcdualusb init --primary /media/usb1 --secondary /media/usb2

# Create an encrypted backup of sensitive data
pqcdualusb backup --data "sensitive.json" --passphrase "your-secure-passphrase"

# Restore data from backup if needed
pqcdualusb restore --backup-file backup.enc --restore-primary /media/usb_new
```
