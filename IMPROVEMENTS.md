  - Configurable Argon2 parameters
  - Security thresholds and limits
  - Environment variable integration
  - Security level validation and warnings

### 8. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Improved fault tolerance
  - Retry mechanisms for I/O operations
  - Graceful fallbacks for failed operations
  - Better error messages and diagnostics
  - Secure cleanup on exceptions

### 9. Interactive CLI Improvements
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Better usability
  - Interactive USB drive selection
  - Detailed drive information display
  - Input validation with clear error messages
  - Progress feedback during operations

### 10. Memory Security Enhancements
- **Secure Data Handling**: Protection of sensitive information
  - Automatic memory clearing on program exit
  - Secure temporary file handling
  - Protected passphrase storage
  - Zero-fill sensitive variables

## New Features Added

### Command Line Enhancements
- `list-drives` command with detailed drive information
- Interactive drive selection for init/rotate operations
- Progress reporting during long operations
- Input validation with helpful error messages

### Security Features
- Memory locking for sensitive data
- Timing attack protection in verification functions
- Secure temporary file creation and cleanup
- Enhanced cryptographic parameter validation

### Operational Improvements
- Automatic audit log rotation
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Better cross-platform USB drive detection
- Configurable security parameters

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Protection
```python
with SecureMemory(size) as secure_buf:
    # Sensitive operations in locked memory
    secure_buf[:len(data)] = data
    # Automatic cleanup on exit
```

### Progress Reporting
```python
progress = ProgressReporter(description="Operation")
progress.set_total(total_bytes)
# Update during operation
progress.update(bytes_processed)
progress.finish()
```

### Timing Attack Protection
```python
# Constant-time hash comparison
result = TimingAttackMitigation.constant_time_compare(hash1, hash2)
# Random delay to prevent timing analysis
TimingAttackMitigation.add_random_delay()
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `DUAL_USB_ARGON2_M`: Memory cost for Argon2 (KiB)
- `DUAL_USB_ARGON2_T`: Time cost for Argon2 (iterations)
- `DUAL_USB_ARGON2_P`: Parallelism for Argon2 (threads)

### Security Parameters
- Minimum passphrase length: 12 characters
- Token size range: 32-1024 bytes
- Audit log size limit: 10 MB
- Random delay range: 50-200ms

## Backward Compatibility
All improvements maintain full backward compatibility with existing:
- Encrypted backup files
- Token storage formats
- Audit log formats
- Command-line interfaces

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test USB drive detection on all supported platforms
2. Verify memory protection functions under high load
3. Test audit log rotation under various conditions
4. Validate timing attack protections
5. Verify secure cleanup functions

## Future Enhancements
1. Hardware security module (HSM) integration
2. Biometric authentication options
3. Network-based backup verification
4. Advanced entropy analysis
5. Formal security audit integration

## Summary
The implemented improvements significantly enhance the security posture and operational reliability of the dual USB backup system while maintaining ease of use and backward compatibility. The system now provides enterprise-grade security features suitable for high-security environments.
